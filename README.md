# The-crypt-of-the-heart-of-eternity
First unity game

This game is not for commericial use as it is just for my personal experiense with game design.
This game also makes use of several assets from the Ultimate survival asset pack which is ment only for educational purposes.

To run the game please add the scenes menu screen and demo screen into the stack. Then build the game.

The game is a first person dungeon crawler shooter. The goal of the game is to explore the dungeon and kill the boss. Once the boss is defeated, he will drop the heart of eternity which the player can then pick up and win the game.
